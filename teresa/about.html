    <p>"Allow your inner beauty to truly shine through" - </p>
    <p>TEXT GOES HERE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT YOURSELF TERESA..THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I HAD FOR THE OTHER SITE!!!.....Is there a real Beatrice behind the Beatrice Spa and Beauty Salon? Yes. In 2003, native 
      New Yorker Beatrice Odessa was seeking a career change. Growing weary from working 
      long hours as a pharmaceutical consultant and medical sales representative, she decided 
      to tap into her strong interest in the spa and beauty world. The daughter of a chemist and 
      a cosmetics saleswoman, Beatrice was already familiar with the enchanting world of <br>
      beauty.</p>
    <p>Encouraged by her friends and family, Beatrice quit her job and traveled the world from 
      Europe to the Middle East to Australia, learning about new body treatments and asking 
      women and men of all ages what they looked for in a luxury spa. Truly listening to 
      what people said about body treatments, and taking their words into consideration, 
      Beatrice knew that opening a spa was indeed her life's mission. </p>
    <p>Always a people-person and always looking for ways to make others feel good both on 
      the inside and the outside, Beatrice wanted to create an ideal spa experience for the 
      people she met on her beauty journey around the globe. Along the way, she became a 
      licensed esthetician and massage therapist. </p>
    <p>When the opportunity came to invest in a spa on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Beatrice <br>
      decided to follow her dreams and open up a day spa in New York where the everyday 
      hard-working woman can relax, unwind, and escape from the pressures of the daily grind 
      which Beatrice knew all too well.</p>
    <p>Working with a team of positive investors who believed in Beatrice and her mission to 
      open a spa, the Beatrice Spa and Beauty Salon officially opened its doors in September 
      2005. </p>
    <p>Since its inception, clients from all over the world have come in for treatments and leave 
      very satisfied. Beatrice is very proud to say that word-of-mouth is the most common way 
      her clients find their way to the Beatrice Spa and Beauty Salon. No client is treated better 
      than anotherÑeveryone who comes in, whether it's for just a pedicure or an entire spa <br>
      experience treated with respect and given the best, most personalized treatment.</p>
    <p>Currently, there is just one Beatrice Spa and Beauty Salon, located in New York City. 
      Encouraged by her clients, Beatrice plans to open other locations in Greenwich, CT and 
      Miami, FL within the next two years.<br>
    </p>
        <h1>Staff</h1>
    <p>Beatrice Odessa is well aware of the importance of having a friendly, knowledgeable 
      staff at the Beatrice Spa and Beauty Salon. Beatrice worked as an executive account 
      manager for over ten years in New York and Atlanta. In that time, she learned the <br>
      importance of people skills and strong communication. Before opening her spa, she also 
    learned what clients wanted and didn't want, from a whole spa experience.</p>
    <p>Beatrice and her staff have an utmost commitment to their client and will work with you 
      to best accommodate you when you visit the spa.</p>
    <p>Every staff member at Beatrice Spa and Beauty Salon is an expert in their respected field
      of beauty. Most of them have been personally recruited by Beatrice to work at the spa. 
      It's important for Beatrice that her staffers feel like family and treat each and every client 
      like family. Clients who have to work with a different staffer due to schedule <br>
      commitments, have complete trust in Beatrice that any staffer they work with will meet 
      their needs.</p>
    <p>Beatrice prides herself on hiring the best of the best when it comes to her employees. The 
      best compliment she ever received was from a female client who told Beatrice that she 
      frequented spas all over the world, but only the staff at Beatrice makes her feel right at 
    home.</p>
    <p>Beatrice and her staff also only use to highest-quality spa and beauty products that are not <br>
      tested on animals and can be used on all sorts of sensitive skin.</p>
    <p>When your birthday rolls around, you'll receive a special gift from our staff as a thank 
      you for stopping into the Beatrice Spa and Beauty Spa.<br>
    </p>
